**Rotaract Bangalore East** is proud to showcase **Hola Santa** - where we Rotaractors hopped from one underprivileged children's home to another to make their Christmas memorable! 

We went on to make every kid smile through activities and games followed by scrumptious plum cakes, Christmas cookies and biscuits. 
We then surprised them by gifting them packets of stationery goodies! 

We visited:
1. **Belaku Shishu Nivasa - Girls Orphanage**
2. **Belaku Shishu Nivasa - Boys Orphanage**
3. **Future India foundation - Madilu sevashrama**
4. **Sri Sai Charitable Trust and home for the underprivileged**
5. **Abalashrama DVG road**

The smile on the faces of the kids made our day in turn and we're extremely grateful to our Parent Rotary as this project wouldn't have happened without you backing us up and supporting us! 

Sending Rotaract Vibes,
